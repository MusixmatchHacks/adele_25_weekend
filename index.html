Let us look at some interesting search and listening/reading (lyrics) trends for the album over the weekend. </p> </section> <section data-name=search_trends> <h1 class=heading> <span>Search trends</span> </h1> <p><a href="https://www.google.com/trends/">Google trends</a> is an interesting tool for comparing google search volumes of various terms. Even though the exact volume of searches is not specified but we can still make some interesting relative comparisons.</p> <h3 class=sub_heading> <span>Over the weekend</span> </h3> <script type=text/javascript src="//www.google.com/trends/embed.js?hl=en-US&q=adele+lyrics,+adele+album,+adele+youtube&date=2015-11-18T00%5C:00%5C:00+96H&cmpt=q&tz=Etc/GMT-1&tz=Etc/GMT-1&content=1&cid=TIMESERIES_GRAPH_0&export=5&w=920&h=350"></script> <p>Comparing these trends we see that all these searches start peaking out on release date which could indicate the listeners looking for lyrics, music, videos and information related to the new album. The <strong>lyrics search volume</strong> is <strong>20% higher than 'adele album' and almost 3 times higher than 'adele youtube'</strong>. Listeners are more interested in reading these than searching for the album or the youtube videos. </p> <h3 class=sub_heading> <span>The last 2 months</span> </h3> <script type=text/javascript src="//www.google.com/trends/embed.js?hl=en-US&q=adele+lyrics,+adele+album,+adele+youtube&date=10/2015+2m&cmpt=q&tz=Etc/GMT-1&tz=Etc/GMT-1&content=1&cid=TIMESERIES_GRAPH_0&export=5&w=920&h=350"></script> <p>In general, the google search trend for lyrics is always higher than the other two. On October 23<sup>rd</sup> the first single from the album <a href=https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Adele-3/Hello>'Hello'</a> was released and we see a massive jump in all the searches. The <strong>lyrics search trend</strong> on 24th October is almost <strong>5 times higher than 'adele album' and 3 times higher than 'adele youtube'</strong>. A similar trend is seen on November 17<sup>th</sup> when the second single <a href=https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Adele-3/When-We-Were-Young>When we were young</a> was released. All in all, lyrics are a very important part of the listening experience. </p> <h3 class=sub_heading> <span>Torrents to the rescue of streaming subscribers ?</span> </h3> <p>This interesting trend was spotted by <a href=https://twitter.com/aweissman/status/667705637250465792> Andy Weissman</a>. The torrent searches start peaking out on release date. One reason could be that Adele chose to not release the album on streaming services which causes the listeners to search for alternatives elsewhere. </p> <script type=text/javascript src="//www.google.com/trends/embed.js?hl=en-US&q=adele+torrent&date=2015-11-18T00%5C:00%5C:00+96H&cmpt=q&tz=Etc/GMT-1&tz=Etc/GMT-1&content=1&cid=TIMESERIES_GRAPH_0&export=5&w=920&h=350"></script> </section> <section data-name=listening_pattern> <h1 class=heading> <span>Listening and reading trends</span> </h1> <p><a href="http://about.musixmatch.com/">Musixmatch's</a> apps are amongst the most used music apps worldwide. Also, our <a href="https://www.musixmatch.com/">website</a> is one of the top lyrics sources on the internet. From both of these we gather a lot of listening/lyrics reading data (anonymised) every minute. Here we zoom in on this data over the last weekend for Adele's new album.</p> <h3 class=sub_heading> <span>Overall</span> </h3> <p>From 19<sup>th</sup> November(Thursday) to 22<sup>nd</sup> November(Sunday), our users have spent <strong>4364 hours (~182 days)</strong> listening to the songs and reading this album's lyrics from our apps and website. This figure shows the total time spent listening to this album and reading the lyrics over this period.</p> <img src=./images/overall.e5811da6.jpg> <h3 class=sub_heading> <span>Analysis by track and platform</span> </h3> <img class="comparison center-block" src=./images/mob.76602396.jpg> <img class="comparison center-block" src=./images/web.89646217.jpg> <p> The engagement in our apps is much higher than our <a href="https://www.musixmatch.com/">website</a>. The engagement everyday over the weekend is similar (~ 1100 hours on the apps and ~50 hours on the website).</p> <p>'Hello' is by far the more listened song from this album right now on both the platforms. This is closely followed by the second single 'While we were young' on the apps, while on the website 'Send my love' is more popular. The other 8 songs are still to gain significant listening.</p> </section> <section data-name=conclusion> <h1 class=heading> <span>Conclusion</span> </h1> <p>Adele's fans were eagerly waiting for this album since 2011, the huge search and listening patterns indicate that this could indeed be a very popular album. The above search trends also show the immense importance of lyrics for music fans. </p> </section> <section class=social> <div class="ssk-sm ssk-group ssk-count" data-url="http://lab.musixmatch.com/adele_25_weekend/" data-text="A data visualization" data-via=Musixmatch> <a href="" class="ssk ssk-facebook"></a> <a href="" class="ssk ssk-twitter"></a> </div> </section> <disqus-thread shortname=musixmatchlab></disqus-thread> </div>  <div class=footer> </div>  <script src=scripts/vendor.4519ba4a.js></script> <script src=scripts/plugins.19a1d77b.js></script> <script src=scripts/main.b6c3df09.js></script> <!-- Google Analytics: change UA-XXXXX-X to be your site's ID. --> <script>(function(i, s, o, g, r, a, m) {
